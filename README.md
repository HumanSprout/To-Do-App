# To-Do-App

ITQ is a simple to do app in the works assigned to me as a challange to learn JS / HTML / CSS

Because I am a glutton for punishment, for the first iteration I will be using vanilla JS

The required functionality includes the ability to ADD, EDIT, DELTE & PRIORITIZE to-do items 

To-do items are added by entering text into the input field and pressing enter

To-do items are prioritized by selecting a value on the dropdown menu (3, 2 or 1)
Priority levels are represented by different colors (3 red, 2 orange, 1 yellow & Null gray)
