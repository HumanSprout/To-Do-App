# To-Do-App

ITQ is a simple to do app in the works assigned to me as a challange to learn JS / HTML / CSS

Because I am a glutton for punishment, for the first iteration I used vanilla JS

The required functionality includes the ability to ADD, EDIT, DELETE, PRIORITIZE and to retain to-do items via localStorage

To-do items are added by entering text into the input field and pressing enter

  ... prioritized by selecting a value on the dropdown menu (Priority levels are represented by color: 3 red, 2 orange, 1 yellow & 0 gray)

  ... marked for completion by checking the check box (completed to-do items are identified by strikethrough text)

  ... deleted by pressing the red button
  
  ... edited by double clicking on the text and then pressing enter (or changing focus) after editing

bugs have been thoroughly squashed and localStorage is functioning as intended.

Time to do it again with JQuery!
